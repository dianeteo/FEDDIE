The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.\nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgageâbacked securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.\nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; Jeffrey R. Schmid; and Christopher J. Waller.\nFor media inquiries, please email\n[email protected]\nor call 202-452-2955.\nImplementation Note issued June 18, 2025\nLast Update:\r\n            June 18, 2025\nBoard of Governors\nof the\nFederal Reserve System\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\nTools and Information\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance\n|\nAudit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspañol\nWebsite Policies\n|\nPrivacy Program\nAccessibility\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page\nFederal Reserve Instagram Page\nFederal Reserve YouTube Page\nFederal Reserve Flickr Page\nFederal Reserve LinkedIn Page\nFederal Reserve Threads Page\nLink to Federal Reserve Twitter Page\nSubscribe to RSS\nSubscribe to Email\nBoard of Governors\nof the\nFederal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551"
